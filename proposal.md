# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The title of my project will be named based of the concept of my game. I haven't fully decided what my game be about because I don't know how hard it will be to implement the idea of my current project as of now so I may switch plans if the project is hard to implement. 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project is a game similar to murder mystery from gmod or I might try to make a tycoon type of game where you have to grind money and upgrades portals to upgrade a specific enviroment. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

So, I have two ideas of now. Either, I want to implement the murder mystery type of gamme or just a little zombie survival game. If I do murder mystery, there will be 3 types of roles. You're the murder, sherieff, or innocent. The goal of the murder is to elimate all the players, along with the cop without getting shot. The cop's objective is to protect the innocent players and try to slowly locate the suspect player who may be the murderer. As an innocent player, your job is to try to stick together or play alone to avoid being killed by the murderer and if you spot the murderer, it is your job to alert all nearby players and work together to take him down. The zombie survival type of game will just be a single player game, where the user spawns in a map and has to shoot/kill zombies and try to survive for as long as possible. This game will be created on a platform known as ROBLOX.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I am not planing on combing this final project with another course's but I will be using another platform known as ROBLOX rather than visual studio code, etc. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

My final project will be with a classmate. His name is Enamul Hoque. I am not sure what their email is because I just send messages through canvas and we talk in the CIS 1051 Discord server rather than through email. 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

One thing I want to accomplish no matter what is getting the idea laid out, the map for the game made and atleast some forms of it functioning if the game isn't fully complete.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Thinking outside the box, I think something I could accomplish is that I can improve problem solving skills and working with others to help communicate better to get the project developed and running. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

For my zombie game, I want to accomplish:
- A map
- Functioning zombies
- Functioning player spawn
- working and shootable guns

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Well, to begin with. The platform ROBLOX uses lua, so I will be picking up another language. Thing I will need to research for this project is on how ROBLOX studio works and how to interact with all the provided tools within the platform. I will be building the map and scripting the components in the game with the help of my team mate but I don't think he will really build since I have prior experience but he does not.
