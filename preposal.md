# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I was thinking about making a little game on python wether it would be something like Tetris, or maybe a game on a platform known as ROBLOX. The language used to code on ROBLOX is mostly LUA but I heard the syntax is similar to python. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

As of right now, I have one classmate I am partnering with and his name is Enamul Hoque. 


## Do you have any questions of your own?

Would we be allowed to make a game on ROBLOX is my big concern because the enviroment to construct a game on there is very easy to use and user friendly when it comes to making maps or using tools such as importing guns for a weapon game or buildings for a map. The only part I would have to worry about is scripting them to make it interatcive.
